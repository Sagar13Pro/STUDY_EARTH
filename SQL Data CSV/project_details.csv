This program detects faces in real time and tracks it. It uses pre-trained XML classifiers for the same. The classifiers used in this program have facial features trained in them. Different classifiers can be used to detect different objects.","<h4>Requirements for running the program:</h4>
<p>1) OpenCV must be installed on the local machine.</p>
<p>2) Paths to the classifier XML files must be given before the execution of the program. These XML files can be found in the OpenCV directory “opencv/data/haarcascades”.</p>
<p>3) Use 0 in capture.open(0) to play webcam feed.</p>

Description : In this, a ball is moving starting from middle and goes to up-left in starting. But, then it collides with wall and changes direction but speed remain same. Consequently, it comes to downward direction where it should be catched on a rectangle (which is capable of moving in horizontal direction) in order to continue.",NULL,NULL,"openGL_ball_game_c++.cpp",NULL,NULL

SQL is one of the most basic methods to use such a database. But have you ever thought about using C++ to maintain such a database. In this post, we will talk about implementing different views on a text file according to the type of user and edit accordingly.
The data stored using this code are: 
1) Registration number 
2) Name

Now for creating this notepad, Python 3 and Tkinter should already be installed in your system. You can download suitable python package as per system requirement. After you have successfully installed python you need to install Tkinter (a Python’s GUI package).",NULL,NULL,"notepad_using_tkinter_python.zip",NULL,NULL

Use the API of the website (if it exists). For example, Facebook has the Facebook Graph API which allows retrieval of data posted on Facebook.
Access the HTML of the webpage and extract useful information/data from it. This technique is called web scraping or web harvesting or web data extraction.
This article discusses the steps involved in web scraping using the implementation of a Web Scraping framework of Python called Beautiful Soup.

Steps involved in web scraping:
Send an HTTP request to the URL of the webpage you want to access. The server responds to the request by returning the HTML content of the webpage. For this task, we will use a third-party HTTP library for python-requests.
Once we have accessed the HTML content, we are left with the task of parsing the data. Since most of the HTML data is nested, we cannot extract data simply through string processing. One needs a parser which can create a nested/tree structure of the HTML data. There are many HTML parser libraries available but the most advanced one is html5lib.
Now, all we need to do is navigating and searching the parse tree that we created, i.e. tree traversal. For this task, we will be using another third-party python library, Beautiful Soup. It is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files.",NULL,NULL,"web_scraping_python_BeautifulSoup.zip",NULL,NULL
